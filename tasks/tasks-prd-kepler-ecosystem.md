- CRITICAL: Tasks based on PRD vision (unlimited AI ecosystem) NOT current limited implementation
- Training module needs complete expansion: ML → Deep Learning → Generative AI → Computer Vision → NLP
- Library management system needs to support ANY Python library source (PyPI, GitHub, custom, experimental)
- Multi-cloud deployment must support any AI framework type (not just traditional ML)
- Edge computing integration with Barbara IoT and Splunk Edge Hub is completely new
- Documentation generation must work for any AI project type (ML, DL, GenAI, CV, NLP)
